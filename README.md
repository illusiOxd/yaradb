# üì¶ YaraDB

**"An intelligent, in-memory-first Document DB with JSON persistence, built on FastAPI."**

YaraDB is a lightweight, document-oriented database designed for small to medium-sized projects that require the flexibility of NoSQL but demand modern data guarantees.

It's built on Python (FastAPI & Pydantic) and runs as an in-memory-first service, persisting all data to a simple `yaradb_storage.json` file on shutdown.

Its core feature is the **"Smart Document"** architecture (`StandardDocument`), which provides data integrity and optimistic locking "out-of-the-box".

---

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Core Features

YaraDB isn't just a "key-value" store. Every document is wrapped in an intelligent "envelope" that provides:

- **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)**: Every document has a `version` field. The `PUT /document/update` endpoint requires this version, preventing "lost update" race conditions. If the version doesn't match, the API returns a `409 Conflict`.

- **Data Integrity**: Every document's body is automatically hashed into a `body_hash` field. This allows you to verify that data hasn't been corrupted or tampered with.

- **Soft Deletes**: Deleting a document (via `PUT /document/archive`) doesn't destroy it. It just sets an `archived_at` flag, preserving your data history.

- **Built-in Indexing**: Fast O(1) reads for `GET /document/get/{id}` via an in-memory hash map.

- **JSON Persistence**: All in-memory data is safely written to `yaradb_storage.json` on graceful shutdown.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Run with Docker (Recommended)

*(Coming Soon - –¢—ã –º–æ–∂–µ—à—å –¥–æ–±–∞–≤–∏—Ç—å Dockerfile –ø–æ–∑–∂–µ, –∫–∞–∫ –º—ã –æ–±—Å—É–∂–¥–∞–ª–∏)*

### 2. Run Locally

**1. Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YaraDB.git
cd YaraDB
```

**2. Create a virtual environment and install:**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # (or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Run the server:**
```bash
python main.py
```

The server is now running on **http://127.0.0.1:8000**.

## üìñ API Reference

### `POST /document/create`

Creates a new document.

**Request Body:**

    "email": "alice@example.com"
  }
}
```

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "name": "user_account",
  "body": { ... },
  "body_hash": "a9f8b...",
  "created_at": "2025-10-29T21:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": null,
  "version": 1,
  "archived_at": null
}
```

---

### `GET /document/get/{doc_id}`

Retrieves a single document by its ID (fast, O(1) read).

**Response (200 OK):**

The `StandardDocument` object.

---

### `PUT /document/update/{doc_id}`

Updates a document only if the provided version matches.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "version": 1, 
  "body": {
    "username": "alice_updated",
    "email": "alice@example.com"
  }
}
```

**Response (200 OK):**

The updated `StandardDocument` with `version: 2`.

**Response (409 Conflict):**

If you try to send `version: 1` again, you will get:
```json
{
  "detail": "Conflict: Document version mismatch. DB is at 2, you sent 1"
}
```

---

### `POST /document/find`

Finds documents using a filter on the body (slow scan, O(n)).

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "username": "alice_updated"
}
```

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
[ ...list of StandardDocument objects... ]
```

---

### `PUT /document/archive/{doc_id}`

Performs a "soft delete" on a document.

**Response (200 OK):**

The `StandardDocument` with `archived_at` set.
